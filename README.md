## Folder organization 📂

|-Assets <br> |-Components <br> |-Constants <br> |- Hooks <br> |- Services <br> |-Pages <br>
|-Context

- In the components folder, usually each component has 2 files, one called _styled.js_ where all the
  styled components are stored, and one with the jsx component

|-Products container

|--|-styled.js

|--|ProductsContainer.jsx

_.... subcomponents_

- The context is stored in folders with the _identity_ name. For example, products would make an
  identity, and points count would make another one.
